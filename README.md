Goal: Lore for all Minecraft items. You can help, too! 

[Contribution guide](https://github.com/DrMeepster/appraisal/wiki/Contribution-Guide)

If you wish to play the latest version mod and don't want to wait for the next release, [clone](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) the project and execute `build.bat`. The mod jar will be in the `build\libs` folder.
